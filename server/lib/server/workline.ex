defmodule Server.Workline do
  @moduledoc """
  The workline stage machine (worklines slice 1, design:
  `docs/plans/2026-08-27-ai-native-sdlc-workline-design.md`). A workline is a thread paired
  with a git folder `work/<slug>/`; its thread carries the stage:

      intent → spec → plan → build → verify → review → merged

  `advance/2` is the single mutation point and carries the invariant: NO advance without the
  stage's owed artifact (checked through the `Server.Workline.Artifacts` behaviour, recorded
  as a CHECK either way, correlation `workline:<slug>:artifact`). Gated transitions —
  spec→plan, review→merged, and a machine-born intent→spec — park in `awaiting: "andrew"`
  instead of flipping; `approve/1` is the operator's completion verb. Every completed flip
  records a `stage_advanced` event: the slice-6 ledger reads metrics out of rows that
  already exist.
